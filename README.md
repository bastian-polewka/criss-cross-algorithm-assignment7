Also known as the Criss-Cross multiplication algorithm, this $50$-lines long algorithm, requiring no advanced math techniques, multiplies large positive integers in string format and returns the exact answer in string format. Multiplication of 1000-digit string numbers can be done almost instantly. This algorithm is nearly twice as fast as the Karatsuba algorithm when the number of digits is below 1000.

# Future work 
- [ ] Store `sum` and `carry` as strings instead of long long data type. Then use addition and subtraction function for strings.

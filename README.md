# VedicMultiplicationAlgorithm
Criss-Cross multiplication algorithm that takes almost 100% LESS time than Karatsuba algorithm. It can multiply 1000-digit numbers almost instantly.
## Time complexity ##
O(n^2) (i think)

Worst case scenario is when the 2 digits have the same number of digits. 
## Function call ##
```cpp
vedic(a, b)
``` 
where a,b are **positive integers in string format**.

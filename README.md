# Criss-Cross Multiplication 

The criss-cross multiplication algorithm multiplies large positive integers in string format. This algorithm is nearly twice as fast as the Karatsuba algorithm when the number of digits is below 1000.

## Usage

## To-do

* [ ] Use object oriented approach
* [ ] Write tests
* [ ] Add github workflow
* [ ] add badges
* [ ] Release
* [ ] Store `sum` and `carry` as strings instead of long long data type. Then use addition and subtraction function for strings.
